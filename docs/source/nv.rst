Nitrogen Vacancy Center in Diamond
=====================================================================
Negatively charged Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in diamond is an
important spin-defect for emergent quantum technologies. 
As diamond has high Debye temperature, even at 0 K, zero-point motion
significantly renormalize the electronic properties.
Recently we showed that quantum vibronic stemming from the ground
state vibrations effects significantly renormalize the single-particle
NV-defect levels and vertical excitation eneries, see the reference
below. In this tutorial we will learn how to calculate such 
renormalizations using stochastic methods.
